    <h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
    <p>Lightning talks are 10-15 minute talks presented during <%= link_to "Campus DevCons", events_main_path %>. They can be about anything related to IT: from highly technical CS topics, to project management, to career advice.</p>

    <p>Here are some quick tips for prospective lightning speakers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep in mind that most of your audience will be students. Make your talk too technical and they'll zone off, make it too shallow and they won't learn anything.</li>
      <li>You have a short time to present. It's much better to have 3-4 main points that you can explain in detail rather than have 10+ points but be cut off by the time limit.</li>
      <li>Slides are optional but are recommended as they can guide both you and your audience on the flow of the talk.</li>
      <li>If you choose to make use of slides, learn to be creative with them. Nothing shuts off a students attention than slides full of bullet points and text. Switch around with text (ie. the 1-6-6 rule) and pictures to keep your audience on their feet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One quick thing to note about Campus DevCons is that most of them are conducted on <em>weekdays</em>. This means that we're looking for speakers who are willing to take a leave from their work to share a bit of their knowledge to students. (Of course, freelancers and flexi-time employees can just take an hour or so off work to give their talk and go back to work afterwards.)

    <h2>Code Camps</h2>
    <p>Code Camps are workshops which introduce technologies (e.g. <a href="http://devcon.ph/events/4th-devcon-android-code-camp-professionals">Android</a>, <a href="http://devcon.ph/events/git-code-camp-for-professionals">Git</a>) or processes (e.g. <a href="http://devcon.ph/events/project-management-camp-scrum-methodology">Scrum</a>) to interested students and professionals. Code Camps require more preparation for both DevCon and the speakers so they are not as common as Campus DevCons.</p>

    <p>Individuals interested to be a mentor or instructor in Code Camps only need to sign up as a speaker in the form linked below. We will inform you once such an opportuntity arises.</p>

    <p>Companies or community groups who wish to hold a Code Camp in partnership with DevCon can refer to <%= link_to "Request an Event", events_request_path %> for details.</p>

    <h2>Sign up as a Speaker</h2>

    <p>As Speakers are practically <%= link_to "Volunteers", volunteer_path %>, the former also uses the same sign-up form as the latter.</p>

    <p><%= link_to "Sign up as a Speaker &raquo;".html_safe, "https://docs.google.com/a/devcon.ph/forms/d/1i-rhXPwGKFBSMgZNkcnzYVs-ZHOQA-Ao9Hu3j8T2wbM/viewform", :class => "btn btn-default btn-success btn-lg" %></p>
