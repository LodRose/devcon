    <h1>About DevCon</h1>

    <p>Developers Connect Philippines (DevCon) is a BIR and SEC registered non-profit, non-government organization which aims to empower Filipino developers and promote the "IT Pinoy Talent" by providing unique venues for IT students, educators, professionals and enthusiasts to <em>Sync, Support and Succeed</em>.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>DevCon was founded in June 26, 2009.</p>

    <p>DevCon is a pioneering project of the Philippine Software Industry Association (PSIA). Its pilot event, DevCon Visayas, was held at the TechBar in Cebu City. DevCon also spanned a ten-city nationwide tour as part of the Next Wave Cities roadshow run by the then Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT) and Business Processing Association of the Philippines (BPA/P) in 2009.</p>

    <p>To increase its reach, DevCon has signed a partnership with the Philippine Society of IT Educators (PSITE) to make DevCon accessible to IT students nationwide. Furthermore, to ensure that DevCon's presence will continue to grow, DevCon registered under the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-profit organization.</p>

    <h2>DevCon's Achievements</h2>
    <p>DevCon is the youngest yet most comprehensive IT capabilities development organization in the Philippines. Known for hosting free <em>unconferences</em> for IT students, educators, professionals and enthusiasts, DevCon has grown to having over <em>20,000</em> participants since June 2009. It is highly sought after by educational institutions through its campus DevCon programs that aim to augment the academic learnings of students with up-to-date trends in the IT industry.</p>

    <p>Aside from its regular activities, DevCon also organizes special events that promote the IT industry. Two of the big special events so far are the Hack2Hatch: From Hacker to Founder and DevCon Code Challenge Cup (C-Cup).</p>
    
    <p><em>Hack2HATCH: From Hacker to Founder</em> was co-organized DevCon and PhilDev, a non-profit that promotes tech innovation in the Philippines.
